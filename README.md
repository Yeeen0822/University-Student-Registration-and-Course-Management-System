Utilizes HashMap and List as Abstract Data Structures
Language: Java

This project implements a Student Course Registration System using HashMap and List as Abstract Data Structures (ADTs) to efficiently manage student records, courses, and registration details.

## Key Features:
Encapsulation: Data is protected through private attributes and public methods.
Polymorphism: Methods are overridden for different course types.
Abstraction: Interfaces and abstract classes ensure modularity.
Efficient Data Storage:
HashMap<String, Student> → Stores students with unique IDs.
HashMap<String, Course> → Stores courses with unique course codes.
List<Student> → Manages ordered lists of students for reports.
